            <u><b>Physics</b></u> <i>is the natural science that studies matter</i>,[a] its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through 
            space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.[2]<br> Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, 
            with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves.[b][3][4][5]
            Physics is one of the oldest academic<br> disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, 
            perhaps the oldest.[6] Over much of the past two <u><mark>millennia, physics, chemistry, biology,</mark></u> and certain branches 
            of <b>mathematics</b><br> were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century 
            these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.[c]<br> Physics intersects with 
            many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics
            are not rigidly defined.<br> New ideas in physics often explain the <mark><b>fundamental mechanisms</b></mark> studied by other sciences[3] 
            and suggest new avenues of research in<br> these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and <del>philosophy.</del>
